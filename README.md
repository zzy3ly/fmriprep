MRI Analysis Docker Image
This Dockerfile sets up an environment tailored for MRI analysis, integrating a wide range of tools and libraries essential for processing and analyzing MRI data. It's designed to provide a comprehensive suite of applications for researchers and practitioners in neuroimaging and related fields.

Key Features
Pre-installed software for MRI processing, including MRtrix3, FreeSurfer, FSL, ANTs, and DSI-Studio.
Python environment with libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) validation tool.
Neuroimaging tools like AFNI and FMRIPrep.
Building the Image
To build the image, make sure Docker is installed on your system and run:


docker build -t mri-analysis .
Usage
You can run a container based on this image with:

docker run -it --rm mri-analysis
Software Included
MRI Processing and Analysis Tools
MRtrix3: Provides tools for diffusion MRI analysis.
FreeSurfer: An open source software suite for processing and analyzing (human) brain MRI images.
FSL: A comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI, and DTI brain imaging data.
ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools): A state-of-the-art medical image registration and segmentation toolkit.
DSI-Studio: A diffusion MRI analysis tool that maps brain connections and correlates findings with neuropsychological disorders.
Python Libraries
NumPy, SciPy, Pandas: Fundamental packages for scientific computing with Python.
Scikit-Learn, Scikit-Image: Tools for data mining and data analysis.
Nipype: Provides a uniform interface to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction between these packages within a single workflow.
PyDicom, NiBabel: For reading and writing DICOM and NIfTI files, respectively.
DIPY: A toolbox for analysis of MR diffusion imaging.
Other Tools
BIDS Validator: A tool for validating the compliance of datasets with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, required for some neuroimaging tools.
AFNI: A set of C programs for processing, analyzing, and displaying functional MRI (FMRI) data.
FMRIPrep: A robust tool to prepare functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for higher-level analyses.
Environment Variables
Several environment variables are set to configure the paths for the included software. Please check the Dockerfile for details.

Notes
This image is based on base:dev. Make sure this base image is available or modify the Dockerfile accordingly.
The Dockerfile assumes the presence of specific package files in the /tmp directory. Ensure these files are available or modify the paths as needed.
You may need to adjust permissions and user settings depending on your Docker setup and how you intend to use the software.
Support
